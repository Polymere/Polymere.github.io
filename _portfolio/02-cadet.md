# Making engineers life easier

Sept 2024 - 1 month

While concurrency is a great way to optimize a computer vision pipeline, it is often not a concept that is easy to understand and work with
for junior robotics engineer  / interns without a strong computer science background.
It can also make develloping prototypes or benchmarking different algorithms more work than it should be.

**what I did**

This brought

- A big improvement in developer velocity, as iterating on perception algorithms and integrating them in our pipeline could be done separately
- A way to ensure the software would comply for QMS criterias, by making it easy to extract intermediate results and compute metrics on large datasets.
- Decoupling between the hardware and software, allowing a fast derisking of alternate sensors
